# Health-care-data-analysis-dashboard
## Project Objective
-To analyze patient blood test data using Power BI and uncover patterns in health metrics such as Hemoglobin, Glucose, WBC, and Platelets.
-The dashboard helps identify trends by age group and gender, supporting healthcare professionals in making data-driven wellness decisions.

## dataset used
-<a href="http://github.com/RakshithaMaddala/Health-care-data-analysis-dashboard/blob/main/Patient_Blood_Test.xlsx">dataset</a>

## Key Features
-Visualization	Description
-Bar Chart	Count of Patients by Age Group
-Table	Patient Name, Hemoglobin, and Range
-Gauge Chart	Avg Hemoglobin vs. Target Range
-Area Chart	Avg Hemoglobin by Age Group
-Scatter Plot	WBC vs. Platelets correlation
-Slicers	Gender, Age Group, and Hemoglobin Range

## Dashboard Overview
-The Healthcare – Patient Blood Test Analysis Report visualizes key patient metrics through dynamic KPIs and charts.
-It allows filtering by Gender, Age Group, and Hemoglobin Range.

## Includes:
 -Patients Count
 -Average Age
 -Average Hemoglobin (g/dL)
 -Average Glucose (mg/dL)

## Insights
-Patients aged 31–40 show the highest count and balanced hemoglobin levels.
-Average Hemoglobin (13.16 g/dL) lies within the normal range.
-Glucose (102 mg/dL) is slightly above optimal levels.
-A positive correlation is observed between WBC and Platelets, showing healthy immune activity.

## Tools & Techniques
-Power BI – Dashboard design and DAX calculations
-Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning
-Excel – Source dataset

## Future Scope
-Integrate Sales Data to connect health trends with product sales (Dashboard 2).
-Add Geographic Map for city-level health analysis. 
-Enable auto-refresh for real-time medical reporting.
